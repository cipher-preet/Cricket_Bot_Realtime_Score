This was Dawkins\\\\u2019 third successive half century against India in this series. England were always in control of the chase, thanks to the explosive batting of Dawkins and Ben Mayes which helped England cross the 100-run mark in just 15 overs. Earlier in the day, RS Ambrish had scored a fighting, back-to-the-wall 66 (not out) to drag India past the 200-run mark on Monday. Ben Dawkins is really in a hurry to finish the game. He\\'s smashed the India bowlers for 39 runs off 31 balls as England breeze past the 50-run mark in just nine overs. Mayes at the other end has just scored seven runs so far.
